Tab : Create new Subscribr Popup
Row no.: 69 CXS_USERS table 
From this subscriber popup insert only user name,start date and end date data only. Isn’t it? 
Actually here we have not data for password or resource name and others fields which are required for the table CXS_USERS.
Row no. 17: MIDDLE_INITIAL field has no link to store data.
Row no. : 68,70 which data is stored in table CXS_APPLICATION_ASSIGMENTS from Add New Subscribers 
Row no. 77 still I think its pending but can we store this data in table? If yes in which field?
What is the work of “View SLA” button.

Tab : Subscriber Administration Data
Row no. : 39 we have not CXS_APPLICATIONS table instead of it we have SYS_APPLICATIONS which is structured in tab : Access Management row no. 145. 
Please elaborate this combo box functionality.

Row no. 51 : Please Explain design style of update button functionality. 
As the row no. 48 says all fields are editable. Can we edit subscriber name and username from here too.
