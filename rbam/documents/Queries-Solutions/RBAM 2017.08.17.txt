

sheet name : User Administration - 2

1)we created two tables by our own ideas because their structures are not in excel sheet. We create the tables like


CXS_RESOURCES 

Table:	CXS_RESOURCES				
					
LAST_UPDATED		DATE			
DATE_CREATED		DATE			
LAST_UPDATED_BY		NUMBER			
CREATED_BY		NUMBER			
LAST_SESSION_ID		VARCHAR2(240)			
RESOURCE_ID		NUMBER			
FIRST_NAME		VARCHAR2(240)			
LAST_NAME		VARCHAR2(240)			
ENTITY_ID		NUMBER		from Org Table	
DESCRIPTION		VARCHAR2(240)			
RESOURCE_TYPE		VARCHAR2(100)			
CONTRACTOR_TYPE_FLAG		VARCHAR2(100)			
PARTY_ID		NUMBER			
CONTRACT_ID		NUMBER			
CONTRACT_ID		NUMBER			
RBAC_ID		NUMBER			
SUPREVISOR_ID		NUMBER			
JOB_CLASSIFICATION		VARCHAR2(240)		From Classification Module	
START _DATE_ACTIVE		DATE			
END_DATE_ACTIVE		DATE			



    2. CREATE TABLE `cxs_application_roles` (
        `APPLICATION_ROLE_ID` BIGINT(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        `ROLE_NAME` VARCHAR(40) NULL DEFAULT NULL,
DATE_CREATED		DATE			
LAST_UPDATED_BY		NUMBER			
CREATED_BY		NUMBER		
        `LAST_UPDATE_DATE` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        PRIMARY KEY (`APPLICATION_ROLE_ID`)
        )
        ENGINE=MyISAM


2) Application Roles (row no. 119) is not required but when entered role start date , role end date both are required ? 
-- START_DATE is mandatory
-- END_DATE is not mandatory
-- Every date field must have a calendar popup
-- Date format must be Day, Month, Date and Year
-- All Mandatory fields should be required yellow
(i need to elaborate rowno.104)

3) How to link cxs_application_roles and cxs_application_assignments tables. (i need to elaborate
APPLICATION_ROLE_ID

rowno.101-106 and 119)

4) Please elaborate
 rowno. 154&155 rule no.3,4. From where user can edit the records?

-- User can edit records in data grid only.
-- Only checked, selected rows can be edited only.
-- When records are checked, then user will click Update Selected button
-- When that button is clicked, selected records will be changed to updateable and all columns can be updated.
-- When records are in update mode the background if each data grid cell for selected record will turn white.
-- Once update are made, save button will save the record into database.
-- For every update, system must update following columns and these columns are visible using eye icon.

-- CREATED BY - the user_id value of the username who is logged in
-- LAST_UPDATED BY - the user_id value of the username who will update.
-- CREATION_DATE - system date and time on the server
-- LAST_UPDATE_DATE - system date and time on the server.

Please note that,  when create user is created for the first time, created_By and last_updated_By user will be same. creation_Date and last_update_date will also be the same. This is because record is inserted for the first time.

However, during update, only LAST_UPDATE_DATE and LAST_UPDATED_BY should change. CREATION_dATE  and CREATED_bY  should not change.

5) In Create User Form : Can we set Application Role as dropdown box for master data instead of textbox ? Yes, please. Dropbox.

6) What should display In the Grid User Administration under title 'Active User'(last second column) on page users-administration.html.

Possible Values are "Active" and "Inactive".

If end_Date in CXS_USERS is less than system date  that means user is Inactive. Otherwise it is active.
